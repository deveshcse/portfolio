          I am a front-end developer with a background in machine learning and
          full-stack development. Starting as a machine learning intern, I have
          now shifted my focus to front-end development, where I build
          responsive and dynamic web applications. I work with tools like React,
          TailwindCSS and Framer Motion to create clean, user-friendly
          interfaces.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left md:px-40 lg:px-60 text-xl text-gray-700">
          Though early in my career, I have contributed to real-world projects
          through internships, consistently expanding my technical skills. My
          experience in full-stack development allows me to effectively
          collaborate with back-end teams to ensure smooth integration across
          the entire system.
        </p>
        <p className="text-left md:px-40 lg:px-60 text-xl text-gray-700">
          Iâ€™m ready to take on projects with businesses of any size, bringing
          fresh ideas and a hands-on approach. Feel free to get in touch to
          discuss and advise on your project or development needs.
